    description
	"This YANG module provides a data-model for the Clixon RESTCONF daemon.
         There is also clixon-config also including some restconf options.
         The separation is not always logical but there are some reasons for the split:
         1. Some data (ie 'socket') is structurally complex and cannot be expressed as a 
            simple option
         2. clixon-restconf is defined as a macro/grouping and can be included in
            other YANGs. In particular, it can be used inside a datastore, which
            is not possible for clixon-config.
         3. Related to (2), options that should not be settable in a datastore should be
            in clixon-config
