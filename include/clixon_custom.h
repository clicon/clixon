  Custom file as boilerplate appended by clixon_config.h 
  These are compile-time options. RUntime options are in clixon-config.yang.
  In general they are kludges and "should be removed" when cod eis improved
  and not proper system config options.

 * The easy way to do this is to always generate all prefix/namespace bindings

/*! Set a temporary parent for use in special case "when" xpath calls
 * Problem is when changing an existing (candidate) in-memory datastore that yang "when" conditionals

 * Problem is that the tree is in an intermediate state so that a when condition may not see the
 * full context.
 * More specifically, new nodes (x0) are created without hooking them into the existing parent (x0p)
 * and thus an xpath on the form ".."/PARENT may not be evaluated as they should. x0 is eventually 
 * added to its parent but then it is more difficult to check trhe when condition.
 * This fix add the parent x0p as a "candidate" so that the xpath-eval function can use it as
 * an alernative if it exists.
 * Note although this solves many usecases involving parents and absolute paths, itstill does not
 * solve all usecases, such as absolute usecases where the added node is looked for
