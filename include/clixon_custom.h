  Custom file as boilerplate appended by clixon_config.h 
  These are compile-time options. Runtime options are in clixon-config.yang.
  In general they are kludges and "should be removed" when code is improved
  and not proper system config options.

 *
 * See https://github.com/clicon/clixon/issues/90
 * Instead of using generic xmlns prefix bindings, the module's own prefix
 * is used.
 * In the CLI generation case, this is actually quite complicated: the cli 
 * needs to generate a netconf statement with correct xmlns binding.
 * The easy way to do this is to always generate all prefix/namespace bindings 
 * on the top-level for the modules involved in the netconf operation.
 * Update 2022-11: seems most cornercases are covered and this is now disabled.
 * I am sure there are remaining cases but undef this for now and close #90

/*! Set a temporary parent for use in special case "when" xpath calls
 *
 * Problem is when changing an existing (candidate) in-memory datastore that yang "when" conditionals
 * should be changed in clixon_datastore_write.c:text_modify().
 * Problem is that the tree is in an intermediate state so that a when condition may not see the
 * full context.
 * More specifically, new nodes (x0) are created without hooking them into the existing parent (x0p)
 * and thus an xpath on the form "../PARENT" may not be evaluated as they should. x0 is eventually 
 * added to its parent but then it is more difficult to check the when condition.
 * This fix add the parent x0p as a "candidate" so that the xpath-eval function can use it as
 * an alernative if it exists.
 * Note although this solves many usecases involving parents and absolute paths, it still does not
 * solve all usecases, such as absolute usecases where the added node is looked for
