/*! XPath expression type
 *
 * An expression is evaluated to yield an object, which has one of the following four basic types:
 *  node-set (an unordered collection of nodes without duplicates)
 *  boolean (true or false)
 *  number (a floating-point number)
 *  string (a sequence of UCS characters)

/* Expression evaluation occurs with respect to a context. XSLT and XPointer specify how the 
 * context is determined for XPath expressions used in XSLT and XPointer respectively. The 
 * context consists of:
 *  a node (the context node)
 *  a pair of non-zero positive integers (the context position and the context size)
 *  a set of variable bindings
 *  a function library
 *  the set of namespace declarations in scope for the expression

 * For each node in the node-set to be filtered, the PredicateExpr is
 * evaluated with that node as the context node, with the number of nodes
 * in the node-set as the context size, and with the proximity position
 * of the node in the node-set with respect to the axis as the context
 * position; if PredicateExpr evaluates to true for that node, the node
 * is included in the new node-set; otherwise, it is not included.
