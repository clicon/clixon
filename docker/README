This dir contains docker code - how to build clixon as docker containers
     cli     Build olofhagsand/clixon_cli container
     backend Build olofhagsand/clixon_backend container
     netconf Build olofhagsand/clixon_netconf container

Perform the build by 'make docker'. 
You may also do 'make push' if you want to push the image, but you may then consider changing the image name (in the makefile:s).

You may run the container directly by going directly to example and
the docker runtime scripts there
