- New option: CLICON_DB_XML with new xml-based database. This makes more efficient
	implementation of yang-based applications. 
- Changed yang type lookup to be lexically instead of dynamically scoped (as
  they should) by using a cache (yang_type_cache).
- Added support for yang 'max' range keyword
- Added option:  CLICON_YANG_MODULE_REVISION
- Cleaned up xml translation functions in clicon_xml_map.c	
- Extended client/backend protocol with dumping a database config: CLICON_MSG_DBITEMS
- Removed -a (appdir) config options. Use only -f <config-file>.
- Added INET (IPv4) communication between client and backend. Not only UNIX. Experimental.
- Removed clicon_dbmatch.[ch]. Replaced with clicon_dbitems_match().
- Replaced internal clicon_proto_ messaging API with clicon_rpc_.
- Extended tree-based access functions: clicon_dbget_parent/children/descendents/xpath.
- clicon_dbctrl: Renamed brief option from -P to -b and made it work with -m 
- Reference documentation using doxygen: make doc, make graphs
- When entering CLI commands, they appear in the same order in xml and reload.
- yang parse error using '+' in strings
- New example: clicon_yang for stateless yang experiments (no backend)
- Event subscription API: add/delete/each
- Long-term mem-leak in chunk-code
- xml parser did not support "<a></a>" only "</a>"
- fixed error in event-loop if timers are used: events before now caused hanging
